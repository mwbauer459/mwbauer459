- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Max.
I'm currently a Software Quality Associate working triage for Waymo. In my free time I love to do web development and I am constantly trying to expand my knowledge base and improve my skill set. I have a strong understanding of HTML/CSS/Javascript and am currently gaining experience with Node.js, Express and angular.
