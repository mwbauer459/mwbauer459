- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Max.
I'm currently a Software Quality Associate working triage for Waymo. In my free time I love to do web development and I am constantly trying to expand my knowledge base and improve my skill set. I have a strong understanding of HTML/CSS/Javascript and am currently gaining experience with Node.js, Express and angular. To look at some of my work check out the following repos: 
1. /leaguer.com - a personal website project of mine
2. /CSE130 - A collection of assignments and labs from my capstone course at UCSC. Check out assignments to see my work with sorting and optimization algorithms, and labs to see my work with operating systems and locks/semaphores.
3. andyboyad/unversity-token - a school project for which I was responsible for creating the database and handling data.
